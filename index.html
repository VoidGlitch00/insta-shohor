            <h4>How does JavaScript work?
            </h4>
            <p>JavaScript is a popular client-side programming language. Client-side scripting language refers to a scripting language that operates on the client side of web browsers. When a browser opens a page, it contains a built-in interpreter that reads and executes any JavaScript code it finds. However, keep in mind that the client's web browser must support JavaScript or be JavaScript enabled. Most recent web browsers now have JavaScript engines and support it. For example, V8 JavaScript engine is a feature of Google Chrome.</p>
            <h4>What is the purpose of JavaScript Event Loop?
            </h4>
            <p>Javascript, for example, is single-threaded, meaning that it only performs one action at a time. We call javascript synchronous because it only performs one action at a time on a single thread. But what if a job takes too long to complete, or what if all other codes/ functions/ tasks are put on hold while we wait for this one to finish? This has the potential to slow down the performance of our apps. To prevent such consequences, javascript features an event loop-based concurrency architecture that allows it to handle several jobs asynchronously.</p>
            <h4>What is the differences between Local Storage and Session Storage?
            </h4>
            <p>The fundamental difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is there is no expiration date of data in localStorage, while the sessionStorage stores data from a single session which expires after the session is closed. The localStorage object aids in the storage of data that does not expire. As a result, even if the browser is closed, this information remains. To put it another way, the user has unlimited access to a page's local storage. Thus, data might be obtained the following day, a week later, or a year later. On the other hand,SessionStorage has identical capabilities as localStorage, but it only retains data for a single session. As a result, when a user closes a browser tab, the data is destroyed. And that is why, it aids with the storage of data in the session. Any page from the same site that is open in that window can be used to access it. The session is ended whenever the user closes the window. The sessionStorage object, meanwhile, allows string data from a given session to be stored.</p>
